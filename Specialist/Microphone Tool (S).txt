desc:  A-A format converter

// this tool is intended to process "ambisonic" microphone signals, if the capsules are omni directional , and make them (super) cardiod by subtracting the whole from the individual. This method is used because A format quality exceeds B format quality, and I want to use them for 3D surround applications. I'm not sure if this FX actually works as intended.
