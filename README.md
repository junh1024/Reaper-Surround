# Reaper-Surround

A collection of my mostly surround JSFX. Docos are sparse. If you don't understand what a FX does, the FX is probably too specialized for your use.

Hopefully all of it should be made/modified by me. If it isn't, leave a comment & I'll remove.

Instructions
===
These are JSFX so DOWNLOAD ZIP & Put them in your Reaper EFFECTS folder.

Example workflows
===
